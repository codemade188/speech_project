The buyers agent looks through the list of houses for sale posted by the sellers agent. The buyers agent shows your house to potential buyers. When someone makes an offer, the buyers agent will let the sellers agent know about the price that the buyer has offered. After everyone agrees, the house is sold. The price associated with selling a house is based on commission. The sellers agent will get an average of 2.5 percent of the selling price and the buyers agent will get 2.5 percent as well. If the price of the house was $300,000, then each agent will get $7500, costing you a total of $15,000.",Business

The problem with Jake is that he doesn't know that he is an idiot.,Business
"I remember helping Jake out so much, and then he stabs my back.",Business

I think the manager likes him because he kisses her ass all day long.,Business

This is a dead end job. I don't see much of a future here.,Business
I hate the redundancy. It's so boring.,Business
Work isn't exciting for me anymore. I am doing the same thing over and over again.,Business
This company doesn't care about employees that much. I haven't received a fair raise in 3 years.,Business
"I don't know if it is my manager or this company, but I'm really getting sick of my job.",Business
What do you think about all the politics in this company?,Business
The politics suck here. But it is the same for any large corporation. The best way to deal with it is to take advantage of the rules.,Business
I don't know how much longer I can take this job. I've been thinking about applying to a different company.,Business
Have you ever thought about leaving this company?,Business
What company do you want to switch to?,Business
I started applying for other jobs. There are a lot of positions open.,Business

"Hi Mark, the addition we made to the project made it difficult to complete by myself. If the deadline doesn't change, I will need some help to complete it. Can you assign someone to help me out?",Business
I have spent every minute on this project and have been putting in serious overtime. This project is a lot bigger than we anticipated. I am going to need some help to complete it on time. Do you have anyone available to help me?,Business

I'm having a hard time working with ABC Company. They are always late and the work they do has numerous errors. It is really frustrating because I have to spend a great deal of time proof reading the material. I recommend not giving ABC Company any more work.,Business
"Hey Mark. I'm doing all the projects you gave me, but John gives me additional work. I don't mind it, but lately it's been too much.",Business

John wants me to do the payroll analysis. He said he needs it by end of week. But didn't you want the employee headcount finished by Friday? I can't finish both. What should I do first?,Business
I'm having some problems with John lately. He is very critical and puts me down in public. I don't know what I am doing wrong so I don't know where I need to improve. What do you think I should do about this?,Business
"John has been very difficult to work with. He is very bossy and expects everything to be done his way. I have been tolerating it because he is a manager, but some of his methods are wasting a lot of time. I always suggest other ways, but he will not hear me out.",Business

Do you think you can finish the marketing report by Friday?,Business
"Our deadline is fast approaching. I try to minimize weekend work, but we might have to work this Saturday if we do not finish on Friday.",Business
I'm not sure about that one. I think the information you are looking for is in a manual I saw in the file cabinet. Why don't you check there?,Business
Do a search on Google and see if you can find the information there.,Business
I think Stacy will know the answer. She is very familiar with that topic.,Business
"I'm not sure on the exact procedure, but if I were you, I would do the forth step before the third one.",Business

"Your work has been pretty good, but I really think you can do better. You have potential and I hope you start trying a little harder.",Business
You have been late for work on a regular basis. You better start coming to work on time.,Business
"This is your third warning. If you are late for work again, we will have to take more serious action on you. Is that understood?",Business
Being late for work once in a while is understandable. But there is no excuse to be coming in to work late every day. You better start coming in on time.,Business
The report was due last Friday. What's going on?,Business
I was working on three other assignments. I just couldn't finish them all.,Business
"If you were not going to finish on time, at least you could have let me know. Regardless, you knew how important this project was and you knew about the due date. What am I going to do with you?",Business
You should have at least told me that you wouldn't be able to finish. Then I could have asked Mary to finish it. This is very irresponsible of you. Is this going to be a continual problem in future projects?,Business

"It's not that bad, but there is no privacy.",Business
I wouldn't mind it so much if the manager couldn't see every minute of my day.,Business
"I hate it. Even if they can't give us offices, they could at least give us cubicles.",Business
"The reason I hate it so much is because I can't take a small break. Since the manager is always looking at everyone, even when I am not working, I have to pretend like I am.",Business
There are a lot of distractions. I can hear everything everyone says in the whole office.,Business

It's roughly 5 by 6.,Business
"I'm not sure, but it fits two small desks and a drawer. I guess it's big enough for me.",Business
